 * This class provides a HBase output operator that can be used to store tuples in rows in a
 * HBase table. It should be extended by the end-operator developer. The extending class should implement
 * operationPut method and provide a HBase Put metric object that specifies where and what to store for
 * the tuple in the table.<br>
