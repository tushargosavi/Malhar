Getting the source code
------------------------

The Malhar repository is on github.com. You can download or clone it using the GitHub links.  If you already have a GitHub account you can fork the DataTorrent/Malhar repository and contribute with pull requests.  See Contributing section below.


Compiling the code
----------------------

The project uses maven to build the code. To build the code run mvn install at the top level. The code also has a dependency to the DataTorrent API. The API releases are available in the DataTorrent maven repository and the Malhar pom.xml is configured with it. Individual modules such as library can be built independently by changing directory to the module and running maven there.

Running the code
-------------------

To run the code DataTorrent platform is needed. The developer version or an evaluation version, both of which are free, can be downloaded from 

https://www.datatorrent.com/download/

Please follow the instructions in the software README on how to run the application.  

For an easer setup, sandbox virtual machine provides pre-configured DataTorrent platform with all necessary dependencies, and can be found in the download section.


Demos
-------------------

Multiple demos are provided with the DataTorrent platform to showcase the platform and provide application development examples.  Demos can be executed after downloading and installing DataTorrent platform or the sandbox with pre-configured DataTorrent platform environment.  See [demos source code](https://github.com/DataTorrent/Malhar/tree/master/demos/src/main/java/com/datatorrent/demos) for application development examples.

Web Apps
-------------------

Web interface for the following demos is available:
- Twitter
- Mobile
- Machine Generated Data
- Ads Dimensions
- Fraud

Web apps run on Node.js. Please see [webapps](https://github.com/DataTorrent/Malhar/tree/master/webapps) for more information.
